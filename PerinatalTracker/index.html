        <h3> Aims</h3>
        <p>
            Our aim is to create a very focused app that will help with a facet of perinatal mental health treatment
            delivery. We are not looking for a <i>“magic bullet”</i> app. Our aim is to create an app that takes full
            advantage of a smartphone platform and will enable both the patient and the practitioner to make the
            treatment task a little bit easier.
        </p>
        <h3>Literature review</h3>
        <p>There is a large amount of literature on the use and effectiveness of smartphone apps in the monitoring and
            management of both general and perinatal mental health disorders.
            <i>“Most studies in gestational diabetes and mental health show that eHealth applications are good
                alternatives to standard practice [ for example ] Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy.”</i>Van Den
            Heuvel et al [8]</p>

        <p><i>“Preliminary data suggests web-based therapies for perinatal depression delivered in the post-partum
                period may play a role in improving maternal mood but more studies are needed” </i>Lee et al [4]</p>

        <Stawarz>Authors stress that it is important to see these apps as an adjunct to rather than a replacement for
            traditional therapies
            <i>“Technology should not be seen as a replacement for traditional psychotherapy, rather it offers new
                opportunities to support mental health as part of an overall ecosystem.”</i>Stawarz et al [7]</p>

            <p>Patient self monitoring is a function highlighted in many reviews.

                <i>“Clients who record their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as part of a CBT-based intervention
                    are able to reflect on their reports and exercise self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is a core feature
                    of many evidence-based psychological therapeutic
                    techniques, including CBT , mindfulness exercises , emotion-focused therapy , DBT, and acceptance
                    and commitment therapy (ACT)“</i> Bakker et al[2]</p>

            <p>How ever Stawarz et al [7] point out that there is a reluctance to use apps in clinical practice <i>“that
                    health professionals are less confident in the efficacy of apps, but it may also be because of
                    institutional [..] lack of awareness of available apps.”</i> They go on to say that to overcome this
                <i> “further engagement with health care providers to understand their needs and raise awareness[.]”</i>
            </p>

            <p>The literature provides guidelines for the creation of efficacious apps for example
                Bakker et al[2] produced sixteen evidence based recommendations for MHapp design. But the most important
                is that they must be grounded in academic and experiential mental health knowledge.</p>
