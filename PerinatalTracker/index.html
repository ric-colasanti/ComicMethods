        <p>There is a large amount of literature on the use and effectiveness of smartphone apps in the monitoring and management of both general and perinatal  mental health disorders. 
<i>“Most studies in gestational diabetes and mental health show that eHealth applications are good alternatives to standard practice [ for example ] Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy.”</i>Van Den Heuvel et al [8]</p>

<p><i>“Preliminary data suggests web-based therapies for perinatal depression delivered in the post-partum period may play a role in improving maternal mood but more studies are needed” </i>Lee et al [4]</p>

<Stawarz>Authors stress that it is important to see these apps as an adjunct to rather than a replacement for traditional therapies 
<i>“Technology should not be seen as a replacement for traditional psychotherapy, rather it offers new opportunities to support mental health as part of an overall ecosystem.”</i>Stawarz et al [7]</p>

<p>Patient self monitoring is a  function highlighted in many reviews. 

<i>“Clients who record their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as part of a CBT-based intervention are able to reflect on their reports and exercise self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is a core feature of many evidence-based psychological therapeutic
techniques, including CBT , mindfulness exercises , emotion-focused therapy , DBT, and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)“</i> Bakker et al[2]</p>

<p>How ever Stawarz et al [7] point out that there is a reluctance to use apps in clinical practice <i>“that health professionals are less confident in the efficacy of apps, but it may also be because of institutional [..] lack of awareness of available apps.”</i> They go on to say that to overcome this <i> “further engagement with health care providers to understand their needs and raise awareness[.]”</i></p> 
 
<p>The literature provides guidelines for the creation of efficacious apps for example
Bakker et al[2] produced sixteen evidence based recommendations for MHapp  design. But the most important is that they must be grounded in academic and experiential mental health knowledge.</p>

<p>What we want to do is create a very focused app that will help with a facet of perinatal mental health treatment delivery.  We are <b>not looking for a  <i>“magic bullet”</b></i> app. We want an app that takes full advantage of a smartphone platform and will give a function to both the patient and the practitioner that makes the treatment task a little bit easier.</p>
